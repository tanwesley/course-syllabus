        <h1>VII. Grading Criteria and Course Policies</h1>
        <h2>Assignments and Course Requirements:</h2>
            <p>Assignments for this course will take the form of Programming Projects, Quizzes,
                Discussion Board topics, a class Demonstration, and a Final Project.
            </p>

        </table>

        <h2>Grading Policies: No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
            submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment. </h2>
            <p>Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
                has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100%
                of the features partially implemented.</p>
            <p>Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:</p>

        <table>
            <tr><td>A  >= 93</td><td>A-  90-92.99</td><td>B+  87-89.99</td><td>B  83-86.99</td>

                    <td>D-  60-62.99</td><td>F  <60 </td></tr>
        </table>

            <p><b>Course Policies: </b>Class attendance is required unless otherwise specified. During our
                class time we will remain focused on the topics at hand, avoid utilizing phones or email,
                and be inclusive of our fellow classmates. </p>
            
            <p><b>Changes to Course Assignents or Grades: </b>Changes to the course assignments or

        <h1>VIII. Practices and Policies during the coronavirus pandemic</h1>

        <h2>Responsiveness to Change</h2>
            <p>Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
                semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to
                any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
                Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
                planned modality this course.</p>

        <h2>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</h2>
            <p>Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
                committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
                Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
                Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
                impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
                college Deanâ€™s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
                will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
                evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.</p>
            <p>Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
                COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
                interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
                for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
                836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.</p>

        <h2>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</h2>
            <p>Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
                physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
                mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
                obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
                the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
                cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
                faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins</p>

        <h1>IX. Information for Students</h1>
        <h2>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</h2>
        <p>Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
            in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
            like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
            Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
            an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since
            accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
            recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
            not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
            information about academic support services, visit the website at:
            www.lewisu.edu/CASE. </p>
        <p>Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
            uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
            Alternative Formats.</p>

        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
            forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
            University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
            expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
            considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
            instructorâ€™s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
            Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
            college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
            except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
            Provost makes the final decision.</p>
